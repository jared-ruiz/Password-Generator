## Challenge 03- Password Generator 

for the third challenge of my bootcamp, I am tasked with creating a password generator using what I have previously learned in JavaScript. 
<br>
<br>

## Criteria to be considered complete (Feb. 2022)

> WHEN I click the button to generate a password
- THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
> WHEN prompted for password criteria
- THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
> WHEN prompted for the length of the password
- THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
> WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
- THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
> WHEN I answer each prompt
- THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
> WHEN all prompts are answered
- THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
> WHEN the password is generated
- THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
<br>

This is the last week where I will be given this criteria. I will be developing my own answers to the proceeding problems as the weeks continue. Wish me luck!
